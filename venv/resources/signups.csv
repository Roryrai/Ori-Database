After completing the game casually I knew it was a really good choice. ,Probably really outdated strats because I haven't been doing any speedruns for like a year lol. ,"Not any currently, used to do a lot of Super Mario Galaxy but I kind of quit that. I did do some randomizer when that tournament was going on some months ago.",
